                                        <p>We may use similar tracking technologies like pixel, local storage, or SDK from time to time, which is explained below. </p>
                                        <li><p><b>"Pixel tags"</b> (web beacons/pixels in general) are files that contain tiny graphics with a unique identifier to recognize the visitors of our website/app. These small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a web page, app, or advertisement can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, such as device type, device operating system, version and type of user's browser, website visited, search history, referring website, etc.</p>
                                            <p>Additionally, through pixel tags, we automatically receive your IP address and other similar information that, includes the small text file (the cookie) that helps the system uniquely identify the device. We place pixel tags to determine the means by which our third-party authorities can set and read browser cookies from a user domain without operating it by themselves. This helps them to collect and achieve information about visitors each time they access that domain, typically with the exclusive permission of the domain owner. </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b>"Local storage"</b> generally refers to other places on a browser or device where information can be stored by websites, ads, or third parties (like, HTML5 local storage and browser cache). We use local storage on certain features to gather information about users’ preferences or analyse your activity. </li>
                                        <li><p>
                                            <b>"Software Development Kits"</b> (also called SDKs globally) function like pixel tags and third-party cookies provided by the developers or software vendors. Although SDK operates in the mobile app context in the absence of the function of pixels and cookies, it helps in the easy integration of services/features.
                                        </p>

                                                Installing SDK or a piece of software code by the primary app developer from partners in the app allows the partner or BLCK Luxury to collect essential information about user interaction with the app. The SDK file related to the user's device and network information also helps us to monitor web traffic patterns, measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and improve site performances.
